PigEditor

Webpage: http://romainr.github.com/PigEditor/

Have been using the nice lightweight Pig Eclipse plugin on http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigTools 
(and not so much the "heavy weight" PigPen) but was wondering if it was possible to do something 
more similar to what Eclipse is doing with Java:

   * automatic error highlighting 
   * check alias name existence 
   * auto complete 
   * outline 
   * ...
 
So I did a first version that works with Eclipse 3.6+
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

There is still a lot to improve and there are some false positive errors highlighted
(trying to be in sync with Pig 0.10 without Macros and Python UDF for now), but feel free to send me your 
feedback/scripts/pull requests.

For building:
Eclipse Helios 3.7 
Xtext 2.0+ http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/

Most important file is the Xtext grammar in org.apache.pigeditor/src: org.apache.pigeditor.Pig.xtext
