PigEditor


Have been using the nice lightweight Pig Eclipse plugin on http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigTools 
(and not so much the "heavy weight" PigPen) but was wondering if it was possible to do something 
more similar to what Eclipse is doing with Java:

   * automatic error highlighting 
   * check alias name existence 
   * auto complete 
   * outline 
   * ...
 
So I did a first version that works with Helios SR2
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/heliossr2

There is still a lot to improve and there are some false positive errors highlighted
(trying to be in sync with Pig 0.9 for now), but feel free to send me your 
feedback/scripts/pull requests.

For building:
Eclipse Helios 3.6
xtext 1.0.2

xtext documentation:
http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/1_0_1/xtext.html#getting-started

Most important file is the xtext grammar in src: org.xtext.example.mydsl.PigEditor.xtext
